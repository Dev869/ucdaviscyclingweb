# UC Davis Cycling Website

## Who can contribute?
Until the site is finalized, anyone within or associated with UC Davis Cycling is free to make any edits!

## How can you make edits?
Since the website does not yet have a domain, direct edits are a bit complex. To do so, you will need to clone the site locally and use a MAMP or WAMP localhost server to make any changes. Additionally, you must commit and push any changes to this GitHub repository after making each edit in order allow other people to access and build on the updated site.
