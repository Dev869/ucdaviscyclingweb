# UC Davis Cycling Website

## Who can contribute?
Until the site is finalized, anyone within or associated with UC Davis Cycling is free to make any edits!

## How can you make edits?
Since the website does not yet have a domain, I am the only one who can make direct edits. Once the website has a live domain, however, anyone can make edits.

## Got content?
We're always going to be in need of new content, so anything from a quote or a picture of yourself to a blog post is greatly appreciated. You may place your submissions for pictures [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/SNaafhyMzHFCbasq7) or email me at devwilson@ucdavis.edu
